# Low HP Studios – Project Context & Vision

## Studio Name
**Low HP Studios**

### Meaning
The name comes from gaming culture where "Low HP" represents a clutch moment — when a player is about to lose but still manages to win.  
It symbolizes:
- Resilience
- Building under pressure
- Smart recovery
- High-impact execution with limited resources

The studio identity is **tech-first with subtle gaming roots**, not a gaming company.
